1. Create a form that calculates the change when the user enters a sum
   and price of goods. Requirements for the form:

- Sum entry field
  Here the user enters the amount of money he/she gives.
- Price entry field
  Here the user enters the price for goods he/she purchases.
- Return the rest action button
  When pressed, the script calculates what is the change for 1 cent,
  5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, and dollars. For example,
  when user enters 3.14 dollars as “Sum” and 0.99 dollars as “Price”,
  the script should give a response “Your rest is 2 dollars, 15 cents”
  (by nominal value of 2 dollars, 10 cents, 5 cents)

2. Create your own implementation of a modal window. Create an HTML
   page with an action button Open Modal Window. After the user presses
   it, a modal window appears. Please note! HTML of the window should be
   auto-generated, NOT implemented into HTML. The window should have
   an action button to close it. After closing, HTML should be deleted from
   the DOM-tree.

- Add an option to create multiple modal windows, and delete them
  after a certain window is closed.
- Create an animation with CSS when opening and closing modal
  windows (they should appear and disappear smoothly).

3. Create a table where user can:
   - Add new data through a form
   - Edit the data
   - Delete any row
     Required fields:
     - Name
     - Surname
     - Email (with proper validation)
     - Date (should be auto-generated)

- Add an option to select and delete multiple rows.
